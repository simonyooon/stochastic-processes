The goal is to design a filter to estimate a signal (target process) and
achieve an MMSE estimate. Using Wiener filtering formulae, we derived
theoretical valeus for correlations to be made applicable in the simulation
of the MMSE estimation. We solve for the impulse response values via the
linear equations of FIR filter length N. We solve for these normal
equations for LMMSE.
