This project simulates the different phases of a Dungeons and
Dragons game. Question 1 of the project focuses on character creation
and the probability in which a given character is created with a certain
strength in each ability. Simulating the roll of multiple dice was done using
randi() and the sum() method. Question 2 analyzes the fight scenes within
the game and either calculates the probability in which combat ends in a certain
way or finds the expected value of the overall combat. Functions were created
for specific parts of both Questions to avoid repetitions in code. All outcomes
were verfied mathematically to ensure correctness.
